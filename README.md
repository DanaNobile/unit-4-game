The goal of this game is to match the randome number that appears on the page to the total score by clicking crystals until the numbers match.

The way the game works:

Computer generates a random number between 19-120 and dispalys on screen
Crystals are assigned a hidden random value buttons between 1-12
When player clicks button, value is added to score 
A win means the total score = random number displayed at beginning
A lose means total score > random number displayed at beginning  
The game restarts happens after win or lose
